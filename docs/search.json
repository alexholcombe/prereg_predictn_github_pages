    "text": "Abstracts\nMath Psych: Mathematical psychologists should preregister more studies\n\nBecause many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there is no advantage to registering such a theory’s predictions in advance of collecting data (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). On that basis, some researchers have argued that preregistration is not worthwhile – the priority should be on developing strong theories (Szollosi et al., 2020). Unfortunately, however, the psychological literature has not done this. What is the solution? I will argue that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Both old and new strong theories that make correct predictions have difficulty attracting the recognition that they deserve. One factor that contributes to this is the scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is strong and makes clear predictions. A second factor is the tragic failure of psychologists to appreciate strong theories. Both factors can be addressed by preregistering more studies, in part because everyone recognizes the value of correct predictions. Finally, while I claim that preregistration is important, it"

### SIPS: Even those with strong theories should preregister their studies

Because many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there may be no advantage to registering such a theoryâ€™s predictions in advance of data collection (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). Some researchers have therefore argued that preregistration is not worthwhile (Szollosi et al., 2020). Yet psychologists have not prioritized the development of strong theories, or even the use of existing ones. Can we do something about this? I will argue that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Strong theories are under-appreciated in part because of the scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is strong and makes clear predictions. But because everyone recognizes the value of correct predictions, preregistration can help strong theories rise to the top. However, additional practices such as head-to-head comparisons of competing theories (Dutilh et al., 2018) may also be necessary.

pushback against the shift in psychology broadly to increasingly preregister studes

the pushback is coming from mathematical psychs

## The argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".1" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom
<!---   Strong theories make relatively precise predictions
    -   no researcher degrees of freedom-->
-   Therefore: Preregistration is redundant

::: {.r-fit-text .nonincremental}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   ~~Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom~~

Fixing the argument
:::

## The argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text .nonincremental}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   ~~Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom~~
-   ~~Therefore: Preregistration is redundant~~

:::

::: notes :::
So, this is not a sound argument for preregistration being redundant.

:::

## Weaker, but more-defensible argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
- Strong theories have FEW degrees of freedom
- Therefore: Preregistration is LESS important for strong theories
    - So, those with strong theories shouldn't bother preregistering

:::

::: notes :::
However, because math psych theories can have fewer degrees of freedom, preregistration is indeed less useful.
I concede that part of their argument. 
This weaker version still may result in a lot of math psychs not preregistering
But there is another reason to preregister!

But there's another problem in psychology.

. . .

<BR><BR>
Very few psychologists are making strong theories (Szollosi & Donkin; 2019; Szollosi & Donkin, 2021).


::: notes :::
Hm, it seems the field doesn't value theory development enough
:::

## My ironic claim <!--can increase theory development--> {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

- Strong theories may benefit more from preregistration than weak theories.
  * How? In *esteem*.

<!--, preregistering differentially rewards strong theories-->

## <!--A different benefit of preregistration--> {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Readers want to know:
  - Is a theory strong?
  - Does it make precise predictions with few auxiliary assumptions?
- God can answer this instantly. Humans can't.

:::

::: notes :::
As long as there are people in this world that need to judge more things than they can read or understand,
God, if she exists, 
The kind of theory that preregistration is least needed for the most well-known benefit is why

## Summary {background-image="images/prereg-badge.original.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

While few d.f. means preregistration has less benefit for guarding against d.f., preregistration has other benefits.

It can help surface our best theories.

## FIN

## Objections

- Many preregistrations are done badly
- Only risky predictions should be rewarded
- Solution: Head-to-head comparisons of competing theories (Dutilh et al., 2018)

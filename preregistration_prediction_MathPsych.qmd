### Math Psych: Mathematical psychologists should preregister more studies
<!-- 8 + 2 minutes-->

Because many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there is no
advantage to registering such a theory’s predictions in advance of collecting
data (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). On that basis, some researchers have argued
that preregistration is not worthwhile – the priority should be on developing
strong theories (Szollosi et al., 2020). Unfortunately, however, the
psychological literature has not done this. What is the solution? I will argue
that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Both old and
new strong theories that make correct predictions have difficulty attracting the
recognition that they deserve. One factor that contributes to this is the
scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is
strong and makes clear predictions. A second factor is the tragic failure of
psychologists to appreciate strong theories. Both factors can be addressed by
preregistering more studies, in part because everyone recognizes the value of
correct predictions. Finally, while I claim that preregistration is important, it

### SIPS: Even those with strong theories should preregister their studies

Because many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there may be no advantage to registering such a theory’s predictions in advance of data collection (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). Some researchers have therefore argued that preregistration is not worthwhile (Szollosi et al., 2020). Yet psychologists have not prioritized the development of strong theories, or even the use of existing ones. Can we do something about this? I will argue that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Strong theories are underappreciated in part because of the scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is strong and makes clear predictions. But because everyone recognizes the value of correct predictions, preregistration can help strong theories rise to the top. However, additional practices such as head-to-head comparisons of competing theories (Dutilh et al., 2018) may also be necessary.

::: notes :::
pushback against the shift in psychology broadly to increasingly preregister studes

one thing to note is where this push-back was coming from Math psychs

"There is also little reason to expect that preregistration will spontaneously help researchers to develop better theories"
:::

## The argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".1" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom
<!---   Strong theories make relatively precise predictions
    -   no researcher degrees of freedom-->
-   Therefore: Preregistration is redundant

:::

## The argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text .nonincremental}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   ~~Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom~~
-   Therefore: Preregistration is redundant

Fixing the argument

## The argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text .nonincremental}

-   Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
-   ~~Strong theories do not have researcher degrees of freedom~~
-   ~~Therefore: Preregistration is redundant~~

:::

::: notes :::
So, preregistration is not redundant.
However, to the extent that math psych theories have fewer degrees of freedom, preregistration seems less useful.
However, there is another reason to preregister!
:::

## Weaker, but more-defensible argument {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Preregistration guards against researcher degrees of freedom <!--(e.g. p-hacking)-->
- Strong theories have FEW degrees of freedom
- Therefore: Preregistration is LESS important for strong theories
    - So, those with strong theories shouldn't bother preregistering

:::

::: notes :::
This weaker version still may result in a lot of math psychs not preregistering

But there's another problem in psychology.

. . .

<BR><BR>
Very few are making strong theories (Szollosi & Donkin; 2019; Szollosi & Donkin, 2021).


::: notes :::
Hm, it seems they don't value theory development enough
:::

## My ironic claim <!--can increase theory development--> {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

- In *popularity*, strong theories can benefit more from preregistration than weak theories

<!--, preregistering differentially rewards strong theories-->

## <!--A different benefit of preregistration--> {background-image="images/isPreregWorthwhile.png" background-opacity=".05" background-size="auto" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- God can instantly determine that a theory is strong and makes precise predictions with few auxiliary assumptions.

- Humans need time.

::: notes :::
God, if she exists, 
The kind of theory that preregistration is least needed for the most well-known benefit is why

-   Show it makes correct predictions ![](images/weatherForecastIcons.png)

## Summary {background-image="images/prereg-badge.original.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

While few d.f. means preregistration has less benefit for guarding against d.f., preregistration has other benefits.

It can help surface our best theories.

## FIN

## Objections

- Many preregistrations are done badly
- Only risky predictions should be rewarded
- Solution: Head-to-head comparisons of competing theories (Dutilh et al., 2018)

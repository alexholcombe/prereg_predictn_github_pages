### Math Psych: Mathematical psychologists should preregister more studies
<!-- 8 + 2 minutes-->

Because many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there is no
advantage to registering such a theory’s predictions in advance of collecting
data (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). On that basis, some researchers have argued
that preregistration is not worthwhile – the priority should be on developing
strong theories (Szollosi et al., 2020). Unfortunately, however, the
psychological literature has not done this. What is the solution? I will argue
that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Both old and
new strong theories that make correct predictions have difficulty attracting the
recognition that they deserve. One factor that contributes to this is the
scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is
strong and makes clear predictions. A second factor is the tragic failure of
psychologists to appreciate strong theories. Both factors can be addressed by
preregistering more studies, in part because everyone recognizes the value of
correct predictions. Finally, while I claim that preregistration is important, it

### SIPS: Even those with strong theories should preregister their studies

Because many strong theories make clear predictions, in principle there may be no advantage to registering such a theory’s predictions in advance of data collection (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021). Some researchers have therefore argued that preregistration is not worthwhile (Szollosi et al., 2020). Yet psychologists have not prioritized the development of strong theories, or even the use of existing ones. Can we do something about this? I will argue that preregistration is, ironically, an important part of the answer. Strong theories are underappreciated in part because of the scarcity of both the skills and the time required to determine that a theory is strong and makes clear predictions. But because everyone recognizes the value of correct predictions, preregistration can help strong theories rise to the top. However, additional practices such as head-to-head comparisons of competing theories (Dutilh et al., 2018) may also be necessary.

::: notes :::
So, preregistration is not redundant.
However, to the extent that math psych theories have fewer degrees of freedom, preregistration seems less useful.
However, there is another reason to preregister!

-   Strong theories have FEWER degrees of freedom

While *in principle* there is no need to preregister strong math psych theories, in practice there are benefits.
 
God can instantly determine that a theory is strong and makes precise predictions with few auxiliary assumptions.

Humans need a time.

## Objections

-   The median preregistration is bad
-   Only risky predictions should be rewarded

##

Those who make decisions that affect resource allocation in science are especially short on time, and often lack expertise. Consider:

-   Editors of prestigious journals
-   Funding panel members and grant reviewers
-   University administrators

Even if they wanted to fund strong theories, these aren't trivial to recognize.

 this assumes perfect knowledge of the theory / no cost to figure out which theories are strong
 
Imagine a landscape of competing theories. A researcher wants to know A) which one is most likely to be correct and should be built on first; B)  a funder which one to fund more work with 

A senior researcher who has been deep in the field for decades might know the relative virtues of the theories and their track record in .

## Yes, strong theories in psychology have degrees of freedom

-   Fewer d.f., however, than weak theories
-   Thus they may still have a prediction advantage over weak theories
-   And yet, psychology researchers aren't doing enough theory development (Szollosi et al., )

## Can we incentivize 

## Are the strong, predictive theories winning?

-   I think not particularly - most of the literature is THIS DOESN'T WORK

## Even for a strong theory with few degrees of freedom, preregistration is valuable

    -   ~~no researcher degrees of freedom~~


-   Strong theories in psychology do not have degrees of freedom

-   The reader of the paper can judge the   

## Predictivism

Even without predictivism, preregistration

p.173 motivates predictions track record
"Peter’s 99 successful predictions indicate that his theory was produced by a reliable method while Adel’s 99 accommodations say nothing about the reliability of his method."

"Notice that “method” need not indicate any concrete algorithm that ‘discovers’ theories. Rather, we may speak loosely of a given researcher’s ‘method’ to generate theories, which may be anything from literature review to dream inspiration. The unit of analysis also need not be individual researchers, but also research labs, universities, disciplines, or any configuration of researchers."

maybe he calls strong theories "mature research programs"? Because he even identifies researchers can as the level of analyais, this is getting close to saying that it surfaces them (Choi, 2024).
But there's also the limited-resources issue.
